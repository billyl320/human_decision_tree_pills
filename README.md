# Interpretable Handmade Decision Tree Model for Pill Shape Classification in Small Data Setting

Pills or capsules are still one of the most popular methods for taking medical pre- scriptions as they are a safe and reliable form of drug administration. However, various communities such as law enforcement agencies, health care providers and recipients, and pharmaceutical companies desire to be able to correctly identify pills using computer vision techniques by law enforcement, health care, and phar- maceutical agencies. Since we cannot perfectly identify pills, it is vitally impor- tant to understand how to identify a pillâ€™s shape. Since some of the pill shape classes are limited while others are plentiful, this increases the complexity in the model building process due to having imbalanced data. Our objective is to create an interpretable model based on shape proportions and encircled image- histograms, SPEIs, using a human guided or handcrafted decision tree using the SVM classification algorithm at each node to discriminate the pill shapes that is applicable in a small data setting.

## Data

The data branch provides all of the data collected from the python scripts.  Additionally metrics were collected but not used in the final model.

## Code

The code branch provides all of the code to perform the analysis.  The image operators and metric collection was performed in python, while the modeling and plot generation was performed in R.  

## Plots

The plots branch provides many of the R generated scatterplots used to manually determine which variables to use to separate potential meta-classes.
